# Contributing Guidelines

## Install dependencies

Install using `yarn` instead of `npm`:

```sh
yarn
```

## Prepare API

Before going further, you should clone the [API repo](https://github.com/highskillmasters/highskillmasters-api) first, then run the development server.

After that you can set the API URL as `localhost`:

```sh
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://localhost:3000
```

During development, it is not encouraged to use the production API.

## Run development

```sh
yarn dev
```

Then it will open `localhost:8000` on your browser automatically.

## Improve components

For now, we're focusing on improving the UI/UX of the whole app and fixing issues.
